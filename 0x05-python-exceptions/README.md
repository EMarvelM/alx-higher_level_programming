- [Learn to Program 11 Static & Exception Handling (starting at minute 7)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eRzZvEg-vQ)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without relying on external resources:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- The difference between errors and exceptions
- What exceptions are and how to use them
- When to use exceptions in your code
- How to correctly handle an exception
- The purpose of catching exceptions
- How to raise a built-in exception
- When to implement a clean-up action after an exception

## Copyright & Plagiarism
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the project tasks yourself to meet the learning objectives.
- Plagiarism, in any form, is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
- Do not publish any content of this project.

## Requirements
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks
This project is divided into several tasks, each of which covers a specific aspect of exception handling. Below are the tasks:

1. **Safe list printing**
   - Write a function that prints x elements of a list.

2. **Safe printing of an integers list**
   - Write a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().

3. **Integers division with debug**
   - Write a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.

4. **Divide a list**
   - Write a function that divides element by element 2 lists.

5. **Raise exception**
   - Write a function that raises a type exception.

6. **Raise a message**
   - Write a function that raises a name exception with a message.

For specific details and examples for each task, refer to the individual task files.
